Full-Stack Developer
--------------------
â¤· I'm a MERN Stack Developer. Making Restful APIs with Node JS and MongoDB is one of my favorite
tasks but I can also work on both (Front-end & back-end) sides by using the MERN stack. I can Secure
your Node Js App with authentication and authorization by using JSON Web Token and hashing your
passwords. If you are looking for a JavaScript developer to get quality work then feel free to contact
me
